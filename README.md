# LLMTutor
A project for a AI tutor
# Creating a Venv
```py -m venv path\to\venv\```

For example, if I wanted to create the venv in a folder in the same directory, I would run

```py -m venv .\venv\```

This creates a folder in the current directory called venv which contains the virtual environment

# Activating the Venv

From your current directory, run the activate file contained with Scripts

```.\venv\Scripts\activate```

# Installing the Requirments

Use pip to install the necessary modules

```py -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Running Main

```streamlit run main.py```
