Statistical Hypothesis
In statistics, a hypothesis is a statement about the parameter of a population. 
Example: An aircrew escape system, commonly known as an ejection seat, is designed to rapidly eject pilots from an aircraft in emergencies. It relies on a solid propellant housed within the rocket motor to provide the necessary thrust for quick ejection. The system's safety and effectiveness depend on the propellant's mean burning rate, which must be exactly 50 cm/s. Any deviation from this rate, either too slow or too fast, can endanger the crew by compromising the ejection process.

Recall: point estimation and CI
Population: propellants of aircrew escape systems 
X: burning rate of a propellent
The first step of any statistical estimation is to take a sample from the population

The key for hypothesis testing is to decide the rejection rule.

We will talk about how to decide critical values later.

Errors in Hypothesis Testing: formal definitions

In the legal system, a courtroom decision involves determining whether a defendant is guilty or not guilty of a crime. The decision is based on the evidence presented during the trial. However, errors can occur in the judgment process.

Guilty
Decision is made based on evidence presented during the trial, just like a sample used to make decision in hypothesis testing. The evidence is a subset of all possible information related to the case (population).
