Two populations
Recall: Hypothesis Testing Procedures
Two Populations
Population 1: people in city A
Population 2: people in city B
X: height of a person in city A
Y: height of a person in city B

Alternative hypothesis


Hypothesis Testing on the Difference in Means of Two Normal Distributions (known variances)
Test Statistic
Null Hypothesis
Distribution under H0
Critical values

Example


Two Populations
Population 1: people in city A
Population 2: people in city B
X: height of a person in city A
Y: height of a person in city B

Alternative hypothesis

Hypothesis testing on the Difference in Means of Two Normal Distributions (unknown and equal variances)
Test Statistic
Null Hypothesis
Distribution under H0
Example
Example
Comparing by descriptive statistics
Two Populations
Population 1: people in city A
Population 2: people in city B
X: height of a person in city A
Y: height of a person in city B

Alternative hypothesis

Hypothesis testing on the Variances of Two Normal Populations
Test Statistic
Null Hypothesis
Distribution under H0
Example
Two Populations
Population 1: people in city A
Population 2: people in city B
X: a person living in the north (X=0) or south (X=1) of city A
Y: a person living in the north (Y=0) or south (Y=1) of city B

Alternative hypothesis

Hypothesis testing on the difference of two population proportions
