General Instructions:
Exam duration: 75 minutes
25 points total (1.2 point per question and 20 questions in total. You get 1 point for free!)
All exam questions are multiple-choices questions: select the answer that is the best in each
question (no partial credit will be given). You do not have to show calculation procedures.
Questions with multiple answers marked or answers that are not clearly marked will receive
no credit.
1. When is a one-sided confidence interval most appropriate?
• A. When estimating a parameter’s exact value.
• B. When only an upper or lower bound of a parameter is needed.
• C. When the variance of the population is unknown.
• D. When comparing two population means.
2. In the context of constructing confidence intervals, which of the following factors will decrease
the width of a confidence interval for the mean (assuming the variance is known), considering other
factors fixed?
• A. Increasing the sample mean.
• B. Decreasing the confidence level (e.g., from 99% to 95%).
• C. Increasing the population variance.
• D. Decreasing the sample size.
3. Which of the following best describes the Method of Moments?
• A. It minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.
• B. It equates sample moments to population moments to estimate parameters.
• C. It maximizes the likelihood of observed data under the model.

is the 95% one-sided upper bound for the true proportion of recovery?

A random sample of 25 students' test scores has a sample mean of 75 and a sample standard
deviation of 10. Construct a 95% one-sided lower bound for the population mean score.

Which of the following statements regarding hypothesis testing is false?
a. A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true.
b. A type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
C. The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when
it is actually true.
17. In a study of 20 college students, the average number of hours per week spent on
extracurricular activities was 6.2 with a sample standard deviation of 2.1 hours. Is there
sufficient evidence to suggest that the average number of hours spent on extracurricular
activities is significantly greater than 6 hours per week? What is an appropriate
hypothesis for this question?
a. 6
b. 𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇 = 6 𝐻𝐻1:𝜇𝜇 < 6
c. 𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇 = 6 𝐻𝐻1:𝜇𝜇 > 6
d. 𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇 ≥ 6 𝐻𝐻1:𝜇𝜇 < 6
e. N𝐻𝐻o 0 n:𝜇𝜇e o=f the𝐻𝐻 a 1 b:o𝜇𝜇ve≠ is6 correct.

above hypothesis?
