Test on the mean of a normal distribution (variance unknown)
Example
Population: propellants of aircrew escape systems 
Null hypothesis
Alternative hypothesis

Sample of size 10 

Test statistic: 

50


10
S is calculated from the sample
Example
Population: propellants of aircrew escape systems 
Null hypothesis
Alternative hypothesis

Sample of size 10 

Rejection criteria: 
Threshold:
Critical values

Pre-specified Type I error probability (a.k.a. significance level of the hypothesis test)


Test on the Mean of a Normal Distribution Unknown Variance
Test Statistic
Null Hypothesis
Distribution under H0
Critical values

Example


Example
P value
More Approaches

Two ways to perform hypothesis testing
Rejection region
Compute p value 

Recall: Hypothesis testing by rejection region: Test on the Mean of a Normal Distribution Known Variance
Test Statistic
Null Hypothesis
Distribution under H0
Threshold:
Critical values

Hypothesis Testing Using P-value
Test statistic  
Reject H0 if 
= P-value
P-value : The smallest significance level that would lead to the rejection of H0
Reject H0 if 
Reject H0 if
